# Task #12: Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure

## Overview
Task #12 implements comprehensive testing infrastructure as part of Phase 4: Quality & Production from the implementation plan. This includes setting up extensive test coverage, performance testing, and security validation.

## Implementation Plan

### 4.1.1 Comprehensive Test Suite
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for MCP server functionality  
- Compliance tests for RFC 7996 validation
- Template system tests
- End-to-end SVG generation tests

### 4.1.2 Performance Testing
- Benchmark SVG generation performance
- Memory usage profiling
- Concurrent request handling
- Large document processing tests

### 4.1.3 Security Testing
- Input validation security tests
- XSS prevention in SVG output
- Resource exhaustion protection
- Malicious input handling

## Files to Create/Modify

### Test Infrastructure
- `tests/unit/` - Unit test suite
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests
- `tests/performance/` - Performance benchmarks
- `tests/security/` - Security validation tests
- `tests/compliance/` - RFC 7996 compliance tests

### Configuration
- `jest.config.js` - Enhanced Jest configuration
- `benchmark.config.js` - Performance testing setup
- `security.config.js` - Security test configuration

### CI/CD
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Comprehensive testing workflow
- `.github/workflows/security.yml` - Security scanning
- `.github/workflows/performance.yml` - Performance benchmarks

## Expected Outcomes

1. **95%+ Test Coverage** - Comprehensive coverage of all components
2. **Performance Baselines** - Established performance benchmarks
3. **Security Validation** - Comprehensive security testing
4. **Automated Quality Gates** - CI/CD integration with quality checks
5. **RFC Compliance Testing** - Automated compliance validation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete unit test suite with 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for all MCP tools and resources
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Security tests validate input handling
- [ ] RFC 7996 compliance tests pass
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines operational
- [ ] Test reports generated automatically

Ready to implement comprehensive testing infrastructure for production readiness.
