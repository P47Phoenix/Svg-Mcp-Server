# Task #15: Final Jest Configuration & Project Completion - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully completed the final configuration optimization for the Jest testing framework, resolving ESM module import issues and establishing a fully functional testing environment. This completes the entire SVG MCP Server implementation with all phases successfully finished.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Final Configuration Optimization

#### Jest ESM Configuration Enhancement
- **Status**: ✅ Enhanced Jest configuration for complete ESM support
- **Transform Patterns**: Updated to handle fastmcp and @modelcontextprotocol modules
- **Module Mapping**: Added comprehensive module name mapping for ES modules
- **Coverage Integration**: Maintained 95%+ coverage requirements with enhanced thresholds

#### Core Configuration Changes
```javascript
// Enhanced transformIgnorePatterns for ESM modules
transformIgnorePatterns: [
  'node_modules/(?!(fastmcp|@modelcontextprotocol)/)',
],

// Comprehensive module name mapping
moduleNameMapper: {
  '^(\\.{1,2}/.*)\\.js$': '$1',
  '^fastmcp$': 'fastmcp',
  '^@modelcontextprotocol/(.*)$': '@modelcontextprotocol/$1'
},
```

    statements: 95
  },
  'src/core/validation/': {
    branches: 98,
    functions: 98,
    lines: 98,
    statements: 98
  }
}
```

#### Multi-Stage Docker Container
